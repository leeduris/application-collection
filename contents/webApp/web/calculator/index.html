<!--
 * This is the main page to display a simple calculator, 
 * and a serching form. As well as I combined my calculator 
 * with the quiz to solve the numeric mathmetical problem 
 * which is inputted by the user. But there is a bug that
 * the form of radio button doesn't work to make only one
 * selection. I am not sure of the reason. I did a exercise
 * to use object concept more for my calculator
