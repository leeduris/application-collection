      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange;">About Me</h2>

        <h3>I am:</h3>
          <p>I am a student who major in computer programming in Sheridan College in Oakville as of
             this September. My job of the dream is to work together in the area of special computer programmers like Java, Java Script, and PHP. You will find that I am a confident, active, and deligent programmer. I am interested in learning the program to make the robot moving like driverless cars. And my another concerning is to develop the software for non-native speakers to learn foreign language easily.
             Even if I am just a fresh computer programmer today, I am making my tomorrow to be a prominent one in
             the future.</p>

        <h3>I am from:</h3>
          <p>I was a cook who studied the culinary art in New Brunswick Community College last year. I had worked in the restaurant in Moncton city until recently. But I made a right decision to share more time with my family after my working in the evening and on holidays. I gave up the skilled work to be make a money, and I took a new choice to obtain more better value of family. I know that making much efforts are required to be a brilliant computer programmer. I believe that a smooth sea never makes a skilled sailor.</p>

        <h3>My Sheridan Journey: </h3>
          <p>Information: I think this course in computer programming in Sheridan College is and will be suitable
             for me owing to the background of my education. As my another major in university, I studied science so that I am accustomed to understand the program coding principle and deal with any kind of coding matters of mechanics, electronics, engineering and data handling. My classmates show me their creative coding sometimes when they encourage me to make my best effort. I know that building my confidence is only to be done by learning.</p>

        <h3>My Insperation:</h3>
          <p>"Life is a long lesson in humility."<cite>(James M. Barrie)</cite> is one of my favorate insperation sentences. This sentence reminds me that studying harder or making more money other than people is not to govern other people with them, but to share them with the poor. In addition, this teaches me that cooperating with each other is the easy way to obtain the best resul. Whenever there is a chance to work together, I will keep it in my mind.</p>

      <h2  style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange;">Reflection on About Me</h2>
        <h3>My feels about sharing About Me:</h3>
          <p>The only courage is needed to share my About Me profile with my future's employers or customers. Because it is scared to introduce myself to the strangers who I have no idea, and my career is poor makes me embarrassed. But I think this is worthy of getting me from one moment to the next, and I believe that this tiny change to share my profile will conduct me to make friends and get a good job.

        <h3>The differences between About Me and My Personal Culture:</h3>
          <p>I mentioned my national origin in the My Personal Culture assignment. Instead, I introduced myself as
             a student in Canadian college in the my About Me profile.</p>
          <p>I refered to my personal issues unconnected with my potential employers or customers like the topic of
             my family's conversation in the My Personal Culture assignment. Instead, I changed to explain my interestings that can appeal to my future's employers in the my About Me profile.</p>
          <p>In the My Personal Culture assignment, I emphasized my creativeness without no specific
             informations. Instead I focused on my skills in computer programming in the my About Me profile.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The informations I left out are:</h3>
          <p>I left out my origin country. Because it can incur the discriminate during hiring process.</p>
          <p>I deleted the word of "creative". Because north-American employers would like to hear about my
             skills and experiences in the computer programmings.</p>
